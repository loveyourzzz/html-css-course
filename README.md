# README

This repository was created for learning Jonas' course [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/), the initial code comes from [Jonas' repository](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course) and on this basis, I have included all the code used during the learning process inside it.

Thank you, Jonas!
